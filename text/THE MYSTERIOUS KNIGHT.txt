You are shown to a chair. For some reason,
this old couple, who introduce themselves as
Lord and Lady Brewmont, welcome your
presence, if only as a distraction from the
grief they seem consumed by.
“We arrived here last night,” Lady
Brewmont begins. “Elric is so busy these
days, so we thought we would bring
ourselves out to Orlbar for a little holiday.
Our son, he’s so fond of the mountains.
Loves all the stories. Well, he’s our grandson
really. The son of our daughter who died
some years ago. He is all we have left of her.
We call him our son.“ Lady Brewmont
begins sobbing once more.
Elric Brewmont picks up the thread. “Long
story short, my friend, we were accosted on
the highway. We were passing along a lonely
stretch of read when he appeared, from
nowhere. A knight, a towering brute of a
man, all clad in armour.” Lord Elric points
to his face. “Did this to me, knocked me out
cold. Then he grabbed our boy, threw him on
a horse and bolted! Without a word!”
“Hmm,” you say, mulling over this
information. “Did he seem familiar, this
knight?”
Elric shakes his head. “I know what you’re
thinking. Wealthy aristocrat, on holiday
from Loudwater, someone must have known
we were coming out here, and siezed the
opportunity. It’s true, I am what you would
call… a public figure. It is well known, in
Loudwater at least, that I am a wealthy
man. But no…. this knight was something
else. We didn’t see his face, it was hidden by
a great metal visor. A towering warrior he
was, a hulk of a man.”
Lady Brewmont speaks again. “And he has
kidnapped our poor little Darek! Abducted
him, just ripped him out of our grasp!”
