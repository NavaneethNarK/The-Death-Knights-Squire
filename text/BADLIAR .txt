The thief shakes his head, pouting angrily at
you.
“I don’t believe this story,” he says firmly.
“You are lying to me. For that, I have a
mind to cast you out and keep everything
you carry…. hmmm.”
He eyes you up and down, considering.
“Instead,” he says finally, “I will take one
thing of value from you. What do you carry?
I don’t want your weapon but… something
else. Show me what you carry. And don’t
bother telling me the real story now. I don’t
want to hear it. You had a chance to tell the
truth, and you chose to lie instead. I want
something from you, in return for letting you
go. For daring to enter our lair and rifle
through our possessions!”
The female stands nearby, caressing the flat
of her blade and eyeing you darkly. The boy
stands motionless, watching you with head
tilted slightly back and hands clasped before
him. You are severely outnumbered here.
You must choose one item worth at least
20gp from your inventory (gold or gems will
also do) and give it to this hardened rogue.
Only then will you be allowed to go free. As
soon as you have done this, you are quite
literally shown the door. Return to tilepage 8
and continue from the last direction you
read.
