You are ushered at bladepoint back into the
abandoned mine, then kicked in the back of
the leg and forced to the ground. This is
when you get your first good look at the
bladewielder: an older man, he appears to be
the leader. He carries a needle-thin rapier in
one hand and a dagger, backhanded, in the
other. You know this fighting style. These
are rogues. Thieves. And, obviously, the
residents of this den.
The woman stands behind you, with weapon
drawn. Sighing resignedly, as if this thing
happens often, the older man finds a chair
and plonks down in it. Suddenly the boy
reappears and informs the leader of what you
had been up to in their treasure room. You
are searched, and any items you took are
retrieved. Then you are bound hand and
foot, and given a boot in the stomach for
good measure.
“So,” the man says finally. “Give me a good
reason why we shouldn’t kill you, intruder?
What’s your story? What are you doing in
Weathercote Wood, and more specifically,
what are you doing in our lair? Who are
you?” he demands.
