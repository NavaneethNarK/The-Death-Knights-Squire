Your primal instinct, your danger sense, is
clamouring, warning you that danger is close
at hand. You don't know the nature of that
danger, but experience tells you that it's
likely a strong enemy is nearby.
It is as if the air itself has been sucked out of
this place. The crypt sits silent and pale as
bone on the far side, shaded by the trees
which border this graveyard
Suddenly you fancy you hear the neigh of a
horse, as if heard from far away, almost like
an echo..
Your barbarian danger sense means that you
have advantage on any dexterity saving
throws you make while in this graveyard.
♦ To move through the rows of gravestones
towards the crypt, despite your instincts,
