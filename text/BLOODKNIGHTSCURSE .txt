Despite your victory, the words of the Blood
Knight are still fresh in your mind. Turning
north at the junction that led you to the 
cemetery, you continue for a short way, after
which this part of Weathercote Wood finally
ends, and the landscape changes to wide,
open grassland, bordered on the east by the
main part of the wood which stretches north.
The sky is overcast, threatening rain, and
pulling poor Darek behind you, you proceed
at a run to a nearby
farmhouse where you steal
a horse. The farmer comes
out of his house as you
gallop away, shouting and
waving his fist at your
back.
You reach Orlbar that
evening, and deliver Darek
to his grateful
grandparents.
“You shall be rewarded,
brave champion,” Lord Brewmont promises,
his eyes misting over. “On the morrow, I
shall go to the Orlbar bank, and –“
You cut Lord Brewmont off, informing him
that there is no time. You want to be out of
this town as soon as possible. Now the Blood
Knight has physical form, he will pursue you
to the ends of the realm, and possibly beyond,
with his army of cultists. You certainly don’t
want those fanatics following you to the
village of Orlbar. That will put all these poor
folk in danger.
Lord Brewmont is sad that he is not able to
reward you properly. But then Lady
Brewmont comes forth, clasping your hands
gratefully.
“Thank you,” she says, and then reaches up
and unclasps her necklace, removing it from
her neck and placing it in your hands. “Sell
this,” she says. “And don’t take anything less
than 700 gold for it!”
Seeing your urgency, Lord Brewmont gifts
you with a horse from his carriage team, and
you mount up and ride immediately, out of
Orlbar and into the deep, inky night.
