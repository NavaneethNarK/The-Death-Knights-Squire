As you are heading south back towards the
four-way junction, you hear a crack of
thunder overhead, followed by a hollow,
ragged laugh, coming from the direction of
the cemetery. A sense of urgency overcomes
you… you sense, in the pit of your stomach,
that time is running out for Darek
Brewmont.
♦ To ignore your instincts and head south
anyway, go to IGNOREINSTINCTS
♦ To return to the cemetery, go to tilepage
10 and follow the directions there
(ignoring anything you have already
encountered or investigated)
