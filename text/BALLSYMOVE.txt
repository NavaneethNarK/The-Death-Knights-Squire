There is a long, awkward silence, and you
fear the worst. Then the Blood Knight
throws his head back and laughs
uproariously, the sound filling the room and
nearly deafening you. You wince, covering
your ears. Finally he stops, and addresses
you, leveling his greatsword under your chin.
Suddenly you feel paralyzed, as if by a spell.
“You are very brave, traveller. You will
make a perfect general for the Goddess. Now
BOW, or DIE LIKE A DOG!”
