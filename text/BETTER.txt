Searching around the nooks and crannies,
you find a few trinkets, items of worship and
other things, mostly worthless.
Then you come across a pile of books, stacked
against the wall. Rummaging quickly
through them, you find a scroll, a little bit
flattened, but then, unrolling it you see
eldritch runes meticulously written in red
ink. At the bottom, in small writing, you see
the following words printed in a neat hand:
A Scroll of Curing Wounds, gifted by
the gracious cleric Kagnar the
Indefatigable. All glory to
Amaunator!
What a find! You stow the scroll in your
backpack, feeling much better about how
things are turning out! This is bound to come
in handy.
(Add a Spell scroll, Cure wounds, 1st Level, to
your inventory. This scroll, when used, will
restore 1d8+2 hp to the user).
♦ To investigate the image of Amaunator,
go to entry INSPECTALTAR
♦ If you have already inspected the altar,
you become mindful that time is pressing,
and you leave this underground chamber.
