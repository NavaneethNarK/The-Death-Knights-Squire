As quietly as you can, you sidle around the
corner… a diagonal passage continues ahead
and opens into a room, which appears to be
illuminated.
You hear the voice again, little more than a
growl shaped into words: “Look at me, cur!
Look at me!”
You take advantage of these words to make a
few more steps, and then you have a view 
into the room. What you see stops your
heart.
Seated on a large throne atop a dais is a
gruesome-looking warrior. Even sitting
down he appears tall; you reckon his height
to be at least seven feet, probably taller. He is
armoured from head to toe, although his face
and parts of his midriff are exposed. The
armour is patched and rusted. In his hand he
holds a huge sword, and he is glaring at the
bound figure grovelling before him. This
figure has their back to you, but you notice
the clothes of a noble. From his size, you
judge this to be a teenage boy; likely Darek
Brewmont. Which can only mean one thing:
the big ugly guy on the throne is the Death
Knight! And it looks as though you have
arrived just in time – this appears to be a
Squiring ceremony!
You feel a malevolent energy pulsing from
the warrior. Watching, your mind races as
you carefully consider your next move.
Oddly, to his right is a brazier which
iemanates an unearthly blue light, casting an
eerie pall over the huge warrior.
Place a token to represent the Death Knight
on the throne, and one representing you near
the door. Don’t worry about a token for
Darek just yet.
Did you succeed on that earlier stealth check?
