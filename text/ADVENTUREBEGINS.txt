At dawn the next day, following the few
scraps of information you have, you saddle
your horse and ride to the outskirts of town.
The townsfolk pay you little mind as you go,
casting you the occasional glance.
The journey to Weathercote Wood lies due
east, but is no short ride. The Captain of the
Guard tells you that the Death Knight has
always been seen in a small patch of wood
that juts out from the western side of
Weathercote, “like a wart on a giant’s nose.”
By midday you reach a sign which tells you
you have another 15 miles to go. You should
make it there by nightfall.
Not far past the sign is a small inn and
tavern. An old man sits on a chair in the
afternoon sun, and raises a tankard of ale as
you pass.
“Last drink for many miles!” the old man
calls to you. “Come, sit! I’ll buy you an ale!”

♦ Do you accept the old man’s invitation? If
so, go to entry BREWSKI.
♦ If you are mindful of the time and choose
to ride on, go to entry KEEPGOING.
