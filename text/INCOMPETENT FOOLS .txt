“What did you do then?” you ask.
“We came straight to Orlbar,” Lady
Brewmont says. “We went to the Captain of
the Guard, but he, he…”
“A thoroughly incompetent fool,” Lord
Brewmont growls. “Said this Knight was a
ghost, that he’d chosen Darek as his squire,
and that there was nothing we could do about
it! Said Darek wasn’t the first. Called him
The Death Knight! You can imagine what a
comfort that was to us.”
“They say the Knight lives in the wood
nearby,” Lady Brewmont says airily, as if in
a waking dream. “Weathercote Wood, isn’t
it dear?”
The old man grits his teeth, staring into the
fire, and punches his palm. “Ghost my arse!”
he snarls through gritted teeth. “That knight
looked real enough to me. He’s a lunatic,
nothing more, a lunatic who kidnaps young
boys! And when I find the blaggard, by the
Gods will he pay!”
You can’t help thinking that Lord Brewmont
is a bit out of his depth here. You don’t doubt
his resolve, but he looks as though his days of
conquest are well behind him.
You feel for this poor old couple. While not
usually associating with the wealthy, you do
know that you have something to offer them,
and you’re never one to shy away from a
good adventure… especially when the chance
of a reward is on the table.
“I can find your boy,” you hear yourself
saying.
The woman looks up, and new hope begins to
shine from her eyes.
“Oh Gods,” she says, her voice quavering.
“We’ll give you anything, anything…”
The old man is a little more practical. “If I
was a few decades younger, I’d be out there
myself. I saw action in the Battle of
Tanglefork, when we freed the Vale from
Rensha rule.”
You nod appreciatively – that battle
happened about 30 years ago, and was said to
be fierce. You are not surprised – Elric
Brewmont definitely carries himself like an
old veteran.
“I can’t put my sword forward any more, but
I can offer you gold, my friend… 2000 pieces
of it, to be exact…”
