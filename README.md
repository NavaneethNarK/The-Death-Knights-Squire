this is a solo DnD adventure game
This is a different kind of module. It is a solo
adventure, designed for use with the Fifth
Edition Dungeons and Dragons rules. It is
designed for a player who cannot find a
group with a dungeon master, but is dying to
play D&D nonetheless.
Given the current resurgence of the game,
there are quite a few of these players around,
who due to geography or just poor luck are
unable to indulge their newfound passion.
This game is written for them, and for those
who would like a little adventure in between
their regular sessions with a dungeon master.
And it is also written for those poor DMs
(like myself) who never get a chance to play
a PC!
A handful of solo adventures were released
for the first and second editions of the game,
such as Lathan’s Gold, Rage of the Rakasta,
Ghost of Lion Castle and a few others of
varying quality. The original red basic box
set also included a solo adventure which I –
and I’m sure many others – have fond
memories of playing through.
However, I personally have not seen many
solo adventures for 5e, apart from a few
floating about online. Time to do something
about that!
This adventure is set in the Forgotten
Realms, but could easily be adapted to any
world.
